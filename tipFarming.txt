Tip for farming inactive cities

Scroll around the map near you looking for cities with relatively high levels (10+) but with low or 0 might.  These are often inactive players who are still producing resources.  Attack them with a few wagons to see if they have any walls (unlikely) and then you can repeat attacks when you need resources.
You can bookmark them anyway you want.  Some Use names like "Farm 1", "Farm 2" so you can keep track of which ones you already hit recently.  You can order them by distance so that you can get some quick res from the closer ones.
