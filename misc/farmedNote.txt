Hi, it looks like you're losing a lot of resources to other alliances recently.  Try to keep your resources on-hand low when you sign off.  If you have extra, try to find someone who can use it on alliance chat, or send non-food res to 152,161.  When you're in need, someone almost always has extra to give on chat as well.

Having wilds tends to generate over-production and can provide more resources to other alliances as well.

Have fun, and play strong
